# ACM & ZTP Examples Repository

This repository contains a collection of example configurations, manifests, and workflows related to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).
The goal is to provide practical, easy‑to‑understand reference material that illustrates how ACM and ZTP components interact in real scenarios, including SiteConfig, ClusterCurator, GitOps flows, and provisioning pipelines.

These examples are intended to help engineers, instructors, and learners explore the concepts behind ACM and ZTP, understand the structure of the resources involved, and experiment in lab environments.
What You Will Find Here

-    Sample SiteConfig and PolicyGenTemplate structures

-    Example ClusterCurator workflows

-    GitOps‑oriented directory layouts

-    ZTP provisioning sequences and wave ordering

-    Supporting manifests for lab or demo environments

-    Notes and comments to clarify the purpose of each resource

This repository is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather a practical companion for understanding how ACM and ZTP operate together.
